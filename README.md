**Plugin for Fleet** that adds several themes to your Fleet.

Create a pull request with your JSON theme config and it will be able on the Marketplace with your theme.


> Basic approach is to create your own plugin and add one or more themes (.json files) and provide it as a plugin.
>
> Such approach isn't good because isn't not convenient to switch themes quickly and not all developers may work with Java / Kotlin.
